# Welcome! This is the index!

Thanks for visiting the page! You are either a **potential employer** considering **potentially awesome people** to work at your **awesome company**, or are **really bored** and wandered in here randomly (or both?), either way ***I'm glad you're here***

It is pretty barebones for now, but someday I would like this to have something useful to someone, someday. But for now, this will just have to be a place to showcase coding. The 2 languages you will find here are **Python** and **Rust**

## For examples of Python
* The [GeneParse package](https://github.com/nwzy/GeneParse) for Ion Torrent
  * [Example Jupyter output](https://nwzy.github.io/geneparse.html)
  
## For examples of Rust
* ### Advent of Code (2019)
  * [Solutions](https://github.com/nwzy/rust_adventofcode2019) (Day 1, 2)
